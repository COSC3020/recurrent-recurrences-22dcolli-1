# Recurrent Recurrences

Give big $\Theta$ bounds for the following recurrence relations.

1.
$$ T(n) =
    \begin{cases}
        1 & n \leq 1\\
        T\left(\frac{n}{13}\right) + 5 & n > 1
    \end{cases}
$$

2.
$$ T(n) =
    \begin{cases}
        1 & n \leq 1\\
        13 T\left(\frac{n}{13}\right) + 5 & n > 1
    \end{cases}
$$

3.
$$ T(n) =
    \begin{cases}
        1 & n \leq 1\\
        13 T\left(\frac{n}{13}\right) + 2n & n > 1
    \end{cases}
$$

## Plagarism Statement

All exercises must contain the following statement:
“I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use
of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated
otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is
suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.”

## Note
I am attempting this from scratch, I will compare it to my last semester repository and make any corrections needed based on that. I really wanted to make this one short and to the point.
